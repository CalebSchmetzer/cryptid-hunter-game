# Cryptid Hunter Game  
## Project Documentation  

**Disclaimer:**  
This is a personal project created for the advancement of my personal knowledge of object-oriented programming and data structures. It is not intended to be a large, fully-realized game (yet). As such, core gameplay is a bit repetitive and luck-based until I get a chance to update it.

## About  
This project is a text-based game where the player takes the role of a government agent part of the CAT (Cryptid Apprehension Team). They must traverse through a variety of regions and attempt to capture the cryptids who lurk there.

## How To Play
You will start in a beginner area which is intended to get you acquainted with the gameplay systems. You can choose to either explore the region (will trigger a cryptid encounter), progress to the next region, backtrack to the previous region (unavailable at the starting region), or view a list of your captured cryptids (starts off empty). Every cryptid encounter will have you play a game of high-low where the cryptid's difficulty level determines the number of correct guesses you need to capture it, as well as the number of total guesses you have before failing the capture attempt.
